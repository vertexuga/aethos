# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-06)

**Core value:** Drawing shapes to cast spells must feel magical -- responsive gesture recognition, visual feedback, and spell effects ARE the experience.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase linear dependency chain -- Foundation -> Gestures -> Spells -> Combat -> Mana -> Levels -> Polish
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 flagged for $1 Recognizer research spike (1-2 hours)
- [Roadmap]: Trajectory aiming (Phase 3) is the killer feature -- validate early, fallback to directional aiming
- [01-01/TECH-001]: Tailwind CSS v4 with @import syntax instead of v3 @tailwind directives
- [01-01/ARCH-001]: Fixed timestep at 16.67ms with delta time cap at 250ms to prevent spiral of death
- [01-01/ARCH-002]: Separate ParticleCanvas (menu) from GameEngine canvas (gameplay)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Hackathon timeline pressure: 24-48 hours total, all 7 phases ambitious. Fallbacks defined per phase.
- Phase 2 needs research spike before planning ($1 Recognizer API, threshold tuning).
