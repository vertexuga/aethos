## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase linear dependency chain -- Foundation -> Gestures -> Spells -> Combat -> Mana -> Levels -> Polish
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 flagged for $1 Recognizer research spike (1-2 hours)
- [Roadmap]: Trajectory aiming (Phase 3) is the killer feature -- validate early, fallback to directional aiming

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Hackathon timeline pressure: 24-48 hours total, all 7 phases ambitious. Fallbacks defined per phase.
- Phase 2 needs research spike before planning ($1 Recognizer API, threshold tuning).
